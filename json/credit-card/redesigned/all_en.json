During this period, you can use the credit without paying interest, provided you repay the full amount by the due date stated on your statement.\u2028Note: The interest-free period does not apply to bank transfers made from the credit card\n\n<b>Billing period</b> refers to the time from the 1st to the last day of the calendar month\n\n<b>Interest rate</b> is an annual interest rate. The borrowed amount is charged interest daily, starting from the day you use the credit, based on the number of days in the given calendar month / 365.\n\n<b>Credit card repayment</b> means paying back part or all of the borrowed amount. The total amount due is shown on your monthly statement and can be paid by regular bank transfer or automatically via direct debit.\n\n<b>Minimum repayment</b> is the amount you need to pay by the 20th of each month. It is set at 2% of your outstanding balance. We’ll automatically set up a direct debit for this minimum payment.\u2028If you prefer to repay the full balance, you can do so by bank transfer or automatically by setting up full direct debit.\n\n<b>100% direct debit</b> is a convenient option that automatically repays your full balance each month (on the 20th), as long as you're within the interest-free period.\u2028If you don’t repay the full amount by the 20th of the following month — or if you use the card for a bank transfer — interest will be charged on the remaining balance at a rate of 22.99% p.a\n\n<b>Payment order from the credit card</b> is similar to a one-time transfer from a current account. This is the only service not covered by the interest-free period — interest starts accruing from the next day after the transfer is made."
